# DSA210_project
This project explores the relationship between stress and the tendency to skip songs using Spotify data.

My objectives are to investigate whether stressful periods lead to increased song skipping and analyze and visualize patterns in total listening time and song-skipping behavior during stressful and non-stressful periods.

I believe there might be a scientific relationship between stress and song-skipping behavior based on factors such as Cognitive Load Theory (stress increases cognitive load, reducing the brain's ability to focus on complex or unfamiliar stimuli), Attention Span Reduction, and the Need for Predictability (stress can heighten the need for familiarity and predictability, causing unpredictable songs to be skipped more often as they require more cognitive effort to process).

The dataset is generated from Spotify's streaming history, including:
Artist name, album name, date, skip information.

Stressful periods are predefined as specific months based on my final exam periods.

Visualizing Total Listening Time by Year
- Bar plots illustrate yearly listening trends, with precise values labeled above each bar.

Song-Skipping Analysis
 - Statistical analysis (t-tests) examines differences in song-skipping behavior between stressful and non-stressful periods.

Hypothesis Testing
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): Stress does not influence the number of skipped songs.
-Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Stress leads to a significant change in song-skipping behavior.
